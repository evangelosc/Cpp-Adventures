# Cpp-Adventures
The project is focused on new and old cpp features.

I try to build a comprehensive repo with different cpp features. My advice is to read "A tour of C++ 2nd edition" by Bjarne Stroustrup before going through these examples.
All codes were compiled using <em>"g++-9 (Homebrew GCC 9.3.0) 9.3.0"</em>.

There are currently three main folders.
* [CppTutorials](https://github.com/evangelosc/Cpp-Adventures/tree/master/CppTutorials): Introduction to the C++ architecture and design.
* [Cpp17](https://github.com/evangelosc/Cpp-Adventures/tree/master/Cpp17): Feature clarifications of the C++17.
* [MITCppCourse](https://github.com/evangelosc/Cpp-Adventures/tree/master/MITCppCourse): MIT Course Number 6.096

TODO:
1) Update main README
2) Update STL README
