# Cpp-Adventures
The project is focused on new and old cpp features.

I try to build a comprehensive repo with different cpp features. My advice is to read "A tour of C++ 2nd edition" by Bjarne Stroustrup before going through these examples.
All codes were compiled using <em>"g++-9 (Homebrew GCC 9.3.0) 9.3.0"</em>.
